# **CodeMate ‚Äì Your AI-Powered Coding Assistant**

### ü§ñ _Advanced AI Integration for Code Development, Analysis, and Testing_

**CodeMate** is a sophisticated **semi-autonomous coding assistant** that leverages multiple AI models to help you develop, analyze, and test code effectively. It uses state-based model selection to optimize AI responses for different tasks while ensuring all modifications are properly tested and integrated.

## üîπ **Key Features**

### 1. **Advanced AI Integration**
- Multi-provider LLM support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure, Groq, LM Studio)
- State-based model selection for optimized responses
- Dynamic context management and token optimization
- Comprehensive error recovery and fallback systems

### 2. **Intelligent Codebase Analysis**
- Deep scanning of `./Workspace/` for project structure
- Automatic identification of frontend/backend components
- Dependency tracking and analysis
- File change monitoring and impact assessment

### 3. **Sophisticated Task Management**
- Automated task planning and workflow creation
- Interactive progress tracking with checklists
- Event-driven task orchestration
- Persistent state management with rollback capability

### 4. **Automated Code Operations**
- Context-aware code generation
- Intelligent code integration
- Style-preserving modifications
- Cross-component compatibility checks

### 5. **Comprehensive Testing**
- Automated test generation and execution
- Multi-level validation (frontend, backend, implementation)
- Test coverage analysis
- Failure recovery and code adjustment

### 6. **Advanced Monitoring**
- Detailed audit logging
- Performance metrics collection
- System diagnostics
- Error tracking and analysis

## üîß **System Requirements**

- Python 3.8+
- Storage: Minimum 1GB free space
- Memory: Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- API Keys for desired LLM providers

## üì¶ **Installation**

### 1. **Standard Installation**
```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd codemate

# Install package
